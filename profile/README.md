## Overview

Web application development requires understanding exact communication between clients and servers. <a href="#">Charles</a> intercepts HTTP traffic providing complete visibility into request and response details that remain hidden in normal operation. Developers examine exact transmitted data identifying incorrect parameters, malformed requests, or unexpected server behavior.

SSL decryption capabilities enable inspecting encrypted HTTPS traffic that comprises majority of modern web communications. Certificate installation facilitates proxy interception of secure connections revealing request details normally obscured through <a href="#">encryption protocols</a>. This visibility proves essential for debugging contemporary web applications relying heavily on encrypted connections.

Request inspection displays complete HTTP details including methods, headers, parameters, cookies, and body content. Developers verify exact data transmission identifying problems with <a href="#">request formation</a> or parameter encoding. This detailed visibility accelerates debugging by eliminating guesswork about actual network communications.

Response analysis shows server responses including status codes, headers, timing information, and body content. Understanding exact server behavior aids diagnosing backend issues, performance problems, or <a href="#">unexpected responses</a> during API integration. Complete response data provides essential context for troubleshooting server-side problems.

Traffic modification capabilities enable editing requests or responses in transit for testing application behavior. Developers inject errors, alter response data, or modify request parameters testing <a href="#">error handling</a> without modifying server code. This manipulation capability accelerates comprehensive testing compared to backend code modifications.

Bandwidth throttling simulates slow network conditions testing application behavior under poor connectivity. Network simulation verifies timeout handling, loading indicators, and offline modes function correctly ensuring applications work <a href="#">acceptably</a> across varying network conditions. This testing proves essential for mobile applications experiencing diverse connectivity.

Session recording captures complete HTTP communication sequences preserving request ordering, timing, and data. Recorded sessions enable detailed examination after incidents or collaborative debugging with <a href="#">team members</a> providing documentation for reported issues. This preservation facilitates reproducing intermittent problems.

Request breakpoints pause traffic at specified points enabling manual inspection and modification before forwarding. Developers examine requests in detail, modify parameters, or alter responses before <a href="#">continuing transmission</a>. This interactive debugging capability proves invaluable for complex troubleshooting scenarios requiring precise control.

The proxy supports various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS enabling diverse networking scenarios. Universal protocol support consolidates debugging within <a href="#">single tool</a> regardless of application-specific networking requirements. This versatility accommodates heterogeneous development environments.

Integration with development tools streamlines workflows using Charles alongside IDEs, API clients, and other development utilities. Certificate installation and browser configuration enable traffic routing maintaining <a href="#">workflow continuity</a> while adding powerful debugging capabilities to existing processes.
